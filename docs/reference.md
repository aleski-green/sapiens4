# Usage and operations

See the [README](../README.md) for startup and platform requirements.

## Work and conversations

ChiefSapi manages the team and can delegate to specialists. Specialists can refer
work to Chief; accepted handoffs retain task identity and return the responsible
Sapi's result to the original chat. **Answer Chief** continues a clarification.
Creating a Sapi or Group does not itself start work.

Personal Tasks offers Upcoming and Past, with read-only YAML specifications and
results. Scheduled routines can be created, edited, paused and resumed through
Chief. Group tasks have shared ownership, revision checks and explicit execution;
saving or restoring a task does not run it. Groups require at least two active
members and one Lead, with up to eleven active memberships per Sapi.

Each Sapi or Group has its own chat, files, Notes and browser workspace. Group
chat defaults to the Lead; explicit mentions address members. Personal and other
Groups' histories remain separate. Retirement and archival preserve saved data.

Stop terminates the runner and child commands but cannot undo completed external
actions. Never-started queued work resumes after restart; previously running work
becomes interrupted and requires explicit retry. Inspect uncertain external
outcomes before retrying. The shared computer allows one owner at a time.

## Notes and files

Memo reads `workspaces/<id>/Notes.html`. Its wiki has `about`, `map` and `content`
sections; about/map enter model context and the model reads relevant content as
needed. Scripts and deliverables remain ordinary linked files. The renderer
allows inert markup and local images while removing executable content.

Native desktop tabs open websites, local files and bookmarks. Text/source files
render literally; HTML, PDF and media use the native browser. Closing a tab does
not delete its file. Remote clients can preview text files and control the host's
tabs, but do not stream native browser views.

## Configuration

Default model: `gpt-6-sol`, reasoning `high`; Deep work uses `xhigh`. A call's
30-minute limit is shared across its decision steps. Environment overrides:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SAPIENS_DATA_DIR` | Data directory |
| `SAPIENS_PYTHON` | Python executable |
| `SAPIENS_CODEX_BINARY` | Codex executable |
| `SAPIENS_CODEX_MODEL` | Model |
| `SAPIENS_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` | Reasoning effort |
| `SAPIENS_BLINDLY_BINARY` | Blindly4 executable |

Decision templates live in `corpora/prompts/`. **Edit decision prompts** saves local
`decision-prompts/*.md` overrides for subsequent invocations; past decision
records retain the prompt they used. Context, Usage and legacy budget settings
are inactive. Global Codex configuration is unchanged.

## Data and updates

macOS/source data defaults to `.sapiens4` in the checkout; Windows packages use
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Sapiens4`. Back up the complete data directory while the host is
stopped, including:

- `corpora.sqlite3`: agents, workloads, Groups, preferences and attachments.
- `agentpy/`: persisted chat state and archives; the legacy path remains in use.
- `workspaces/`: Notes, files and deliverables.
- `decision-prompts/`: local prompt overrides.
- `corpora-identity.json`, registry and remote credential files: identity and trust.

A database-only backup is incomplete. Protect backups as credentials and private
data. Copying a backup retains its corpora identity; it does not create an
independent corpora or synchronize simultaneous hosts. Never run two hosts against
one data directory. Install new versions manually using the platform setup guide.

The header corpora picker changes the viewed workspace; Pause and Activate control
execution separately. Drafts and layout are stored on the viewing device. Cached
remote snapshots are read-only until reconnection. See [remote setup](remote.md)
for pairing, revocation and relay deployment.

## HTTP API

The host binds to loopback. Writes require JSON and `X-Sapiens-Local: 1`;
a supplied Origin must match the loopback Host. Common entrypoints:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/health`, `/api/state` | Readiness and current state |
| POST / PUT | `/api/agents`, `/api/agents/<id>` | Create/update Sapis |
| POST | `/api/agents/<id>/messages`, `/api/agents/<id>/attachments` | Submit chat or attachments |
| GET | `/api/agents/<id>/notes` | Memo and file metadata |
| GET | `/api/agents/<id>/tasks` | YAML export; `?format=json` returns task metadata |
| GET | `/api/agents/<id>/decisions` | Decision records |
| POST | `/api/agents/<id>/control` | Authorized team/workspace operations |
| POST | `/api/agents/<id>/turns/<id>/retry`, `/api/agents/<id>/turns/<id>/cancel` | Explicit recovery |
| GET / PUT | `/api/decision-prompts`, `/api/decision-prompts/<node>` | Inspect/edit templates |

Group notes, messages, attachments, tasks and calls use `/api/groups/<id>`.
Updates require the relevant revision. [RSpec scenarios](../spec) exercise the
public contracts; see [Testing](testing.md) to run them.
