# Sapiens4 for macOS

To open data from an earlier installation, select **Use another folder**, choose
the existing Data Root, then select **Continue**. In the folder picker, **⌘⇧G**
can open a hidden path such as a checkout's `.sapiens4`.

On macOS 13+ Apple Silicon, mount `Sapiens.dmg`, copy **Sapiens4.app** to
Applications (or your own Applications folder), and open it. No Sapiens build
tools are needed. The app opens without Codex; model execution requires your
installed Codex CLI and existing `codex login`. Nothing changes Codex credentials.
The launcher exposes standard Homebrew locations, inherited absolute PATH entries
and the standalone install at `~/.local/bin/codex`. For npm installations in a
custom prefix or shell-managed Node installation, provide that installation's
absolute executable with `SAPIENS_CODEX_BINARY` when launching the app; Finder
does not run shell startup files. If using npm's JavaScript launcher, its Node
executable must also be on the launch environment's PATH. For example:

```sh
SAPIENS_CODEX_BINARY=/absolute/path/to/codex /Applications/Sapiens4.app/Contents/MacOS/Sapiens4
```

Before starting the backend, a fresh installation opens Welcome + Storage.
Start fresh initializes the empty default directory. Use another folder opens a
complete existing Data Root in place or initializes an empty selected folder.
The selected directory is validated first and saved only after Workspace loads;
later launches validate and reuse it. Without a saved selection or explicit\n`SAPIENS_DATA_DIR` override, storage always requires confirmation. Missing, invalid or locked data returns to
the storage screen without creating replacement data.

Onboarding and Workspace share one resizable window.\nThe native window stays responsive; Quit can cancel backend startup.
Workspace loading failures return to the storage screen. View > Reload App\nreloads the page while the owned backend is alive. An exited backend returns\nto storage recovery; reopening a selected folder starts its replacement. Early startup errors appear in a native alert.
Guest document integration loads from the app's packaged `guest.js`; a missing
or empty asset reports a startup error before the backend starts.
Quit Sapiens4 before replacing or removing the app. Quit stops its owned backend;
closing the Workspace window keeps the app running. Closing the storage window
cancels startup and quits. Replacing, removing and reinstalling
the app retain `~/Library/Application Support/Sapiens4/{data,config}`. The backend
log is `desktop-server.log` in the configuration directory, including when\n`SAPIENS_CONFIG_DIR` is set. Older Development directories remain untouched.
Use `SAPIENS_DATA_DIR` and `SAPIENS_CONFIG_DIR` at launch for explicit isolation.
For example, run `SAPIENS_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data /Applications/Sapiens4.app/Contents/MacOS/Sapiens4`.

## Build and verify

Install Command Line Tools, GHC 9.14.1, Cabal 3.18.2, Node.js 22.5+, npm,
Git and stable Rust. Initialize pinned submodules recursively. From the root:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
./environments/macos/build.sh 0.1.0 .build/release-local
(cd .build/release-local && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS)
```

The output directory must be new. It receives only `Sapiens.dmg` and `SHA256SUMS`.
Builds reuse compiler caches and assemble fresh temporary payloads. Local builds
are ad-hoc signed. Each Mach-O must be ARM64, support macOS 13, and resolve all
non-system dependencies inside the app; recursive relocation rejects basename
collisions. The final mounted image is copied, audited and signature-verified.

For a public release, set `SAPIENS_MAC_SIGN_IDENTITY` to a Developer ID Application
identity and `SAPIENS_MAC_NOTARY_PROFILE` to a configured `notarytool` keychain
profile, then add `--release`:

```sh
./environments/macos/build.sh 0.1.0 .build/release-public --release
```

Public builds require both credentials, sign nested code with Hardened Runtime,
notarize and staple the final DMG, then verify the installed app copy with
Gatekeeper and signature checks. Credentials are not stored in outputs.
The installed-app acceptance case is `spec/installed_distribution_spec.rb`.\nIt requires `SAPIENS_TEST_DMG` to point to the image and an unlocked desktop\nwith Accessibility permission.
Native browser tabs, file picking and accessibility behavior retain their existing interfaces.
