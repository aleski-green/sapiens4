-- | Seconds of audio per streamed piece. The host joins pieces and cuts one-minute voice messages.
pieceSeconds :: Int
pieceSeconds = 2

-- | A piece that keeps failing to upload is retried this many times before the recording is dropped.
maxAttempts :: Int
maxAttempts = 5

-- | Recording, ordered upload, the live timer, stopping, cancelling, sending and retrying. Returns true
-- | when it handled the action.
-- | Finished one-minute voice messages come back from the host and wait in the composer. Stop keeps them
-- | there for review; Send (in the recording bar) stops and sends them as soon as recording finishes. On Send, each voice
-- | message becomes its own chat message, in order, as soon as its own transcript is ready: the first
-- | goes at once while later ones are still being transcribed. A failed transcript is never sent: sending
-- | stops there so the person can retry it or remove it.
